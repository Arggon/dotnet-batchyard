description: Close a finished item after verifying its gates
agent: arggon-delivery-lead

Close $ARGUMENTS following the done criteria:

1. Read the item with `tools.arggon.show({ id, body: true })` and verify every
   acceptance checkbox is honest and complete (tick the boxes in the file when
   the work is done).
2. Confirm the change is merged (on the default branch)
   and the gates this project declares pass; run `tools.arggon.validate({})` and require
   `ok: true`.
3. Flip the item with `tools.arggon.update({ id, status: "done" })` — pass
   `{ no_cascade: true }` when an administrative item must not auto-complete
   product containers.
4. Reap the merged worktree with `tools.arggon.cleanup({ prune: true })`: it
   removes the worktree through the OpenCode worktree domain, deletes the
   merged branch and clears the item's `worktree_path` record. Run it without
   `prune` first to inspect the candidates; skipped entries name their reason.
5. If you are a maker subagent: stop at step 2 and report to the delivery lead.
   Completion is the delivery lead's call after merge.
